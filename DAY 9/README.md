# Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates transfer learning using popular pre-trained CNN architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2) on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset. The goal is to classify 102 different flower species by leveraging models pre-trained on ImageNet.

## Dataset
- **Oxford Flowers 102**: Contains 102 flower categories with images of varying sizes
- **Classes**: 102 different flower species
- **Image Format**: RGB images resized to 224x224 pixels

## Models Implemented
1. **ResNet50**: Deep residual network with skip connections
2. **VGG16**: Classic deep CNN with small convolution filters
3. **MobileNetV2**: Lightweight model using depthwise separable convolutions

## Key Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained ImageNet weights with frozen base layers
- **Data Augmentation**: Random flips, rotations, translations, and zoom
- **Custom Classification Head**: Dense layers with batch normalization and dropout
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluation using F1-score and accuracy metrics
