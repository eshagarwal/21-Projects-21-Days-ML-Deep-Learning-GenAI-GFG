# 🚀 Face Resolution Enhancement with U-Net

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a **U-Net deep learning model** for image super-resolution, transforming low-resolution 64x64 images into high-quality 256x256 images. Perfect for enhancing face images with stunning detail! ✨

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🔍 **Input**: 64x64 low-resolution face images
- 🎨 **Output**: 256x256 high-resolution enhanced images
- 🧠 **Architecture**: U-Net with encoder-decoder structure and skip connections
- 📊 **Dataset**: CelebA celebrity faces dataset

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The U-Net model features:
- **Encoder** 📉: Progressively downsamples features (64→32→16→8→4)
- **Bottleneck** 🔄: Captures deep features at 4x4 resolution
- **Decoder** 📈: Upsamples back to target resolution with skip connections
- **Skip Connections** 🔗: Preserves fine details from encoder layers

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras 🤖
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV 📸
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib 📊
- **Architecture**: U-Net with BatchNormalization and Dropout 🏛️
