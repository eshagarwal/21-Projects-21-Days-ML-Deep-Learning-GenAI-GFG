# Titanic Survival Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🚢 📊

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover factors influencing passenger survival. The analysis is performed in `titanic.ipynb` using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and ydata-profiling.
---

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Identify key features affecting survival and gain insights through data visualization and feature engineering. 🎯
- **Dataset:** `Titanic-Dataset.csv` (in the `Data/` folder) 📁

## Workflow Summary 🚀
1. **Import Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. 🐍📚
2. **Load Data:** Read and inspect the dataset. 🔍
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, engineer features (`Has_Cabin`), and drop columns as needed. 🧹
4. **Univariate Analysis:** Visualize distributions of categorical and numerical features. 📊
5. **Bivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between features and survival. 🔗
6. **Outlier Analysis:** Identify outliers in `Fare`. 🚨
7. **Feature Engineering:** Create `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, and extract/simplify `Title` from names. 🛠️
8. **Multivariate Analysis:** Visualize survival rates by combinations of features. 🧬
9. **Correlation Analysis:** Generate a heatmap of feature correlations. 🌡️
10. **Automated Profiling:** Use `ydata-profiling` to generate an HTML report (`titanic.html`). 📑
11. **Conclusion:** Summarize key findings. 🏁

## Key Insights 💡
- **Sex & Title:** Females and children had higher survival rates. 👩‍👧‍👦
- **Class:** 1st class passengers were most likely to survive. 🏅
- **Family Size:** Small families had better survival chances. 👨‍👩‍👧
- **Cabin & Fare:** Having a cabin and paying a higher fare correlated with survival. 💸🚪
- **Port of Embarkation:** Passengers from Cherbourg had higher survival rates. ⚓

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️
1. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code. 💻
2. Ensure required packages are installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ydata-profiling. 📦
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and generate the profiling report. 🔄

## Output 📤
- Visualizations and insights in the notebook. 📊
- Automated profiling report saved as `titanic.html`. 📑
